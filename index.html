                    <ul>
                      <li data-i18n="rule_1">Create your base at a reasonable distance from the other players (say 500+ blocks). Some of your neighbors might be eager to expand! Always remember the Nether is here for traveling quickly from base to base.</li>
                      <li data-i18n="rule_2">Visit the world, marvel at the creations of others! But a creeper just exploded in your face, and it has damaged something that does not belong to you? Fill up the hole, repair the damage. It's really not possible? Leave an apology, mistakes happen.</li>
                      <li data-i18n="rule_3">Also, don't modify other people's creations without their permission.</li>
		      <li data-i18n="rule_4">In a same way, never ever steal inside others chests, even if they are not hidden.</li>
                      <li data-i18n="rule_5">Use whatever client mods you want, as long as it does not impact the other player's experience.</li>
                      <li data-i18n="rule_6">PVP is enabled on the server, but don't kill other players without their consent.</li>
                      <li data-i18n="rule_7">You are in a mood for a good battle? Head over to the PVP Arena and have some fun!</li>
                      <li data-i18n="rule_8">Don't loot community farms (e.g. the unlimited iron farm). Take only what you need for your projects, leave some for others.</li>
                      <li data-i18n="rule_9">You want to submit an idea, need an upgrade, want to organize an event like a PVP fight, post in the Channel Discord called #suggestions</li>
                      <li data-i18n="rule_10">A question, need help with the server, a trusted friend wants to join? Ask Freetonio</li>
                      <li data-i18n="rule_11">Respect the "bubble" of the players when they don't want to be bothered at home.</li>
                      <li data-i18n="rule_12">Be polite and respectful to each other.</li>
                      <li data-i18n="rule_13">Any misuse of language, or bad attitude will be punished</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li data-i18n="rule_13_1">First by a warning to the player at fault</li>
                        <li data-i18n="rule_13_2">Then by a ban more or less long depending on the importance of the fault</li>
                        <li data-i18n="rule_13_3">Any third offence is sanctionned by a permanent ban.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <li data-i18n="rule_14">"TRUST BUT VERIFY". Remember that all actions of all players are recorded at all times by the server for eternity!</li>
